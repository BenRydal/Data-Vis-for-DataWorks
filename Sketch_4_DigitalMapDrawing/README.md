Sketch 4 shifts from focusing on visualizing and interacting with hypothetical data indoors to real, open data outdoors in Atlanta, GA. Specifically, you will load different digital maps, a publicly available data set concerning arrests made in Atlanta, and draw your own movement over these maps and data. Before running Sketch 4, make sure you have downloaded and placed the Unfolding Maps Library folder (included in the introductory message of this tutorial) in the Processing "libraries folder" located within your processing folder on your computer.

SPECIFIC LEARNING GOALS:
1) Understand, discuss the value of libraries
2) Draw, scale, zoom and pan a digital map
3) Run your sketch with a different "map provider"
4) Open/analyze the ATL_2020.csv file (in the data folder) in Microsoft Excel or a similar program. This data set is freely available from the Atlanta Police Department and contains data about arrests made in the year 2020 (see: https://www.atlantapd.org/i-want-to/crime-data-downloads).
5) Load and visualize this data set across Atlanta
6) Draw your movement over one day or a week (your "daily/weekly round") over this data set and map
6) Discuss the use of a "basemap" to contextualize/interpret data
7) Compare/contrast the notion of scale when visualizing data indoors vs. outdoors
