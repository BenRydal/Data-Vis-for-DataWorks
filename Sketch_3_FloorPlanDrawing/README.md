Sketch 3 will continue to familiarize you with Processing while also beginning to demonstrate different ways to create and interact with visual images and data. Specifically, you will draw/hypothesize people's movement over different types of physical spaces (e.g., a basketball court, classroom, and a personally elevant space of your choosing).

SPECIFIC LEARNING GOALS:
1) Begin to understand program organization through tabs
2) Understand ArrayLists/lists & data loading from files
3) Use MousePressed/KeyPressed functions (i.e., learn about graphical user interface (GUI) functions)
4) Draw, compare and contrast qualities of movement in different types of physical spaces
5) Download an image of a personally relevant space from the internet and load that image into this program
6) Compare/contrast movement in your personally relevant learning space with others
